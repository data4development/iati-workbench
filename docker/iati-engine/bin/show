$(basename $0) <file>

Show the given file. Based on the filename extension, an attempt is made to do
formatting and/or syntax highlighting of the contents. For known spreadsheet
file extensions, the file is first converted to CSV.

  $(basename $0) src/iati.xml
    Format the file iati.xml and show it with XML syntax highlighting.

  $(basename $0) input/data.xlsx
    Convert the spreadsheet to CSV and show the output of that.

# also: we assume the rest of the command line is a single filename, possibly with spaces
