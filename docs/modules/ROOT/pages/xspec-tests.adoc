= Xspec tests

The XSLT transformations can be unit tested with the https://xspec.io/[Xspec framework^].
The Xspec library is included as git submodule under `lib/xspec`.

== Test setup

The main test scenarios are organised under `tests/`.

Each main scenario includes smaller subsets in subfolders.

The `build.xml` file contains calls to each of the main scenarios.

[NOTE]
====
A test scenario can only process one main XSLT file.
This file is specified in the `<x:description>` element of that scenario.

Files imported in this main scenario have their own stylesheet specification.
However, these are ignored when running the main scenario.
They can be run on their own too, for instance when using the OxygenXML Xspec features.
