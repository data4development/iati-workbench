= IATI Workbench

_Scripts and tools to investigate IATI data, provide feedback on data quality, etc._

== Add the `iati-workbench` wrapper to your path

You can put the `iati-workbench` script in your path, for instance as a symlink:

  $ ln -s ${PWD}/iati-workbench ~/bin/iati-workbench

This script can help build and run the container.
To see its options:

  $ iati-workbench -h

== Build the container

Before building the container, make sure to check out the git submodules.

  $ git submodule update --recursive

[CAUTION]
====
Work in progress: a local workspace (directory on host machine) is still required to run.
This will become optional.

The local workspace directory has to be mounted under /workspace.
====

In this case, the container will run as the user building the image.
You need to make sure it has proper permissions for the local workspace directory.

=== With `iati-workbench`

  $ iati-workbench -d build

Then, verify everything is running:

  $ iati-workbench

This will show the list of available "targets" in the workbench.

=== Manually

  $ docker build --build-arg UID=$(id -u) --build-arg GID=$(id -g) -t iati-workbench .

You should be able to run it and get a list of available targets:

  $ docker run --rm iati-workbench

This will show the list of available "targets" in the workbench.

== Workspaces

You run the engine in a folder that will function as the 'workspace'.
You specify the task you want performed, and the engine will take all steps needed to transform the source data into the desired output formats.

The `iati-workbench` script will mount the current directory as the workspace.

Once you run any of the tasks, it will create the necessary folders for the source of your data, the intermediary files, and the output files generated.

You can run `iati-workbench init` to create those folders yourself.

=== Sample data

The https://github.com/data4development/demo-workspace[demo-workspace repository] contains example data files.

Clone the repository, and inside the directory, run

  $ iati-workbench spreadsheet-iati
  
This should process the input files and produce a raw IATI file in `src/`.
