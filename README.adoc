Scripts to transform a set of input files (spreadsheets, IATI) into a combined IATI file.

See https://developer.data4development.nl/iati-workbench/[the developer documentation website] for further details.

=== Sample data

The https://github.com/data4development/demo-workspace[demo-workspace repository] contains example data files.

Clone the repository, and inside the directory, run

  $ aida-s2i spreadsheet-iati

This should process the input files and produce a raw IATI file in `src/`.
