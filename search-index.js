The Spreadsheets2IATI section deals with the setup of the convertor to turn spreadsheets and existing IATI files into new IATI data files. The workbench uses two approaches to working with IATI data: Run as a Docker container It runs all the necessary software within an isolated environment. Run as a software build tool It transforms input source files into output compiled files, via one or more targets. The main code is intended to be used as Docker container. This container should have a workspace directory mounted, where data and configuration files are stored. The container can be used as command-line tool, using a helper script. In this case, you will build your own container image, and use it within a directory on your local machine via a helper script. It can also be used in a cloud environment, with an appropriate sidecar or wrapper. In this case, you will need to add an appropriate API, and file and process handling yourself. This documentation describes the first scenario. The tools are split into steps of a \"compilation pipeline\". The steps in the pipeline are typically small scripts and XSLT transformations. We use Ant as orchestration tool. Other orchestration systems would be possible too. For now, you need to follow the steps for Setting up a development environment. This will create a local Docker container image, and make the helper script available. You can then run the engine in a container on your local machine, using the helper script.

This should only happen if converting the available exports of source data into our template formats would be prohibitively difficult and time-consuming. The templates work on tabular data in the same way as our standard templates. They are implemented using an XSLT mode parameter in the XSLT stylesheet templates. The file spreadsheet-iati/csvxml-s2i.xslt is amended to include these additional templates. It will then override the generic template to process a csv record, and implement its own version. Generic example of including client-specific templates for two clients We convert data for two programmes. The OKP programme is where we use a custom configuration. The StuNed programme uses our regular spreadsheet templates, and is included in the conversion. The IATI activity structure for the whole OKP programme consists of four main pillars. Each pillar can have a subdivision, and underneath that the many individual projects that typically are split by funding round and country. In the case of Nuffic, we have a complex mix of input sources: IATI data exported from Akvo for some programmes This data contains general information and results of a few programmes. However, we filter out certain IATI fields that contain too many errors in the Akvo source. Data in Spreadsheet2IATI templates The top-level activities of the OKP programme are not available as Akvo data. Information for these activities is added manually via our regular templates. Also, the result baselines for several projects are not included in Akvo, and are therefore added manually via our results template. In addition, we manually compiled a countries and regions overview of historical projects. To conclude, at least one other programme with embassy funding maintains their own set of spreadsheets in our regular template format. Exports from an older (Atlas) and newer (Delta) project management system These exports contain additional information about some OKP programmes, and require special logic to construct identifiers from one or more input columns. The Atlas data is only for historical purposes and should not be updated any further. The Delta data is for newer programmes and projects. Export from the financial system (Businessworld) This export contains transaction data. Again, we use specific logic to construct identifiers. Figure 1. General overview of the input sources, and four main process flows. To handle this mix of standard and client-specific templates, the code processes the CSV data in both the normal way, as well as in mode nuffic. This section provides more details about the four main process flows (in blue) for the OKP programme in the diagram above. This information is provided in either our standard templates, or in the Akvo export. For IS activities, we don’t use the Akvo data. We do select specific columns to construct an IATI identifier that is consistent across the various exports. For GT activities, we use different columns to construct the IATI identifier, and combine it with data from the Akvo export. For ICP activities, we again use different columns to construct the IATI identifier, and combine it with data from the Akvo export. This is a regular merge of all produced partial data. It includes the StuNed data as well.","title":"Client-specific templates","component":"iati-workbench","version":"next","name":"client-specific-templates","url":"/iati-workbench/next/spreadsheets2iati/reference/client-specific-templates.html","titles":[{"text":"Adding client-specific templates","hash":"_adding_client_specific_templates","id":1},{"text":"Case: Nuffic","hash":"_case_nuffic","id":2},{"text":"Structure of the OKP programme","hash":"_structure_of_the_okp_programme","id":3},{"text":"Processing","hash":"_processing","id":4},{"text":"Top-level IATI activities (process main structure)","hash":"_top_level_iati_activities_process_main_structure","id":5},{"text":"Individual Scholarships activities (process IS data)","hash":"_individual_scholarships_activities_process_is_data","id":6},{"text":"Group Training activities (process GT data)","hash":"_group_training_activities_process_gt_data","id":7},{"text":"Institutional Collaboration Projects (process ICP data)","hash":"_institutional_collaboration_projects_process_icp_data","id":8},{"text":"Merge the data","hash":"_merge_the_data","id":9}]},"12":{"id":12,"text":"The spreadsheet convertor makes an effort to process dates properly.

The workbench uses two approaches to working with IATI data: Run as a Docker container It runs all the necessary software within an isolated environment. Run as a software build tool It transforms input source files into output compiled files, via one or more targets. The main code is intended to be used as Docker container. This container should have a workspace directory mounted, where data and configuration files are stored. The container can be used as command-line tool, using a helper script. In this case, you will build your own container image, and use it within a directory on your local machine via a helper script. It can also be used in a cloud environment, with an appropriate sidecar or wrapper. In this case, you will need to add an appropriate API, and file and process handling yourself. This documentation describes the first scenario. The tools are split into steps of a \"compilation pipeline\". The steps in the pipeline are typically small scripts and XSLT transformations. We use Ant as orchestration tool. Other orchestration systems would be possible too. For now, you need to follow the steps for Setting up a development environment.

The conversion process is initiated by a local call of aida-s2i in the workspace. $ aida-s2i spreadsheet-iati The process breaks down in a couple of components. Figure 1. Sequence for spreadsheet-iati This step takes files from the input folder, and prepares them for processing, in a flat tmp folder. Excel files are converted into CSV. Excel and CSV are then converted into an XML format. Akvo and IATI XML files are copied. This step transforms prepared input files into \"partial IATI\" files. These intermediary files are not valid IATI yet, but contain the IATI representation for the particular input file. This step combines all \"partial IATI files\" into one IATI activities and one IATI organisations file. These files can contain activities that are not IATI schema-compliant. Figure 2.

These are stored in config/csvxml-iati.xslt in their workspace directory. The location of the workspace is variable. However, in XSLT it is not possible to import or include another file using a variable filename. Therefore, we have to add a bit of complexity. The Ant build target first copies a generic template sheets-iati.xslt into the config directory. Next, this stylesheet includes the generic stylesheets using a hard-coded path, and the client variables using a relative path that does need a variable. Possible future development: change this to reading the variables from a JSON file in the workspace. 1 Contains organisation identifier, name, and so on. 2 Can include a file with client-specific templates, and override generic csv processing. 3 Contains generic template functions, and default configuration variables. In XSLT, an xsl:include simply puts the contents of the included file into the including file. Included templates, variables, and so on, will have the same precedence as those in the including file.
