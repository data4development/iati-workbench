The Spreadsheets2IATI section deals with the setup of the convertor to turn spreadsheets and existing IATI files into new IATI data files. The workbench uses two approaches to working with IATI data: Run as a Docker container It runs all the necessary software within an isolated environment. Run as a software build tool It transforms input source files into output compiled files, via one or more targets. The main code is intended to be used as Docker container. This container should have a workspace directory mounted, where data and configuration files are stored. The container can be used as command-line tool, using a helper script. In this case, you will build your own container image, and use it within a directory on your local machine via a helper script. It can also be used in a cloud environment, with an appropriate sidecar or wrapper. In this case, you will need to add an appropriate API, and file and process handling yourself. This documentation describes the first scenario. The tools are split into steps of a \"compilation pipeline\". The steps in the pipeline are typically small scripts and XSLT transformations. We use Ant as orchestration tool. Other orchestration systems would be possible too. For now, you need to follow the steps for Setting up a development environment. This will create a local Docker container image, and make the helper script available. You can then run the engine in a container on your local machine, using the helper script.

The workbench uses two approaches to working with IATI data: Run as a Docker container It runs all the necessary software within an isolated environment. Run as a software build tool It transforms input source files into output compiled files, via one or more targets. The main code is intended to be used as Docker container. This container should have a workspace directory mounted, where data and configuration files are stored. The container can be used as command-line tool, using a helper script. In this case, you will build your own container image, and use it within a directory on your local machine via a helper script. It can also be used in a cloud environment, with an appropriate sidecar or wrapper. In this case, you will need to add an appropriate API, and file and process handling yourself. This documentation describes the first scenario. The tools are split into steps of a \"compilation pipeline\". The steps in the pipeline are typically small scripts and XSLT transformations. We use Ant as orchestration tool. Other orchestration systems would be possible too. For now, you need to follow the steps for Setting up a development environment.

The Ant build target first copies a generic template sheets-iati.xslt into the config directory. Next, this stylesheet includes the generic stylesheets using a hard-coded path, and the client variables using a relative path that does need a variable. Possible future development: change this to reading the variables from a JSON file in the workspace. 1 Contains organisation identifier, name, and so on. 2 Can include a file with client-specific templates, and override generic csv processing. 3 Contains generic template functions, and default configuration variables. In XSLT, an xsl:include simply puts the contents of the included file into the including file. Included templates, variables, and so on, will have the same precedence as those in the including file. An xsl:import creates a precedence tree: the importing file can override a template, variable, and so on.","title":"Client configuration","component":"iati-workbench","version":"1.9.0-1","name":"client-configuration","url":"/iati-workbench/current/spreadsheets2iati/reference/client-configuration.html","titles":[]},"23":{"id":23,"text":"The spreadsheet convertor makes an effort to process dates properly. Google Sheets, Excel, and LibreOffice (soffice) all do different things to recognise date formats. When downloading a Google Sheet with rclone, it will be converted into Excel, with sometimes unexpected conversions. When using soffice to convert to CSV, separate flag can indicate whether to use the shown value or the typed value. This improves the ability to convert. For some US-formatted dates (mm/dd/yyyy) it would be possible to detect its use (for days above 12, which cannot be months). This is not implemented.
