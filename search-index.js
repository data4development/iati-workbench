The Spreadsheets2IATI section deals with the setup of the convertor to turn spreadsheets and existing IATI files into new IATI data files. The workbench uses two approaches to working with IATI data: Run as a Docker container It runs all the necessary software within an isolated environment. Run as a software build tool It transforms input source files into output compiled files, via one or more targets. The main code is intended to be used as Docker container. This container should have a workspace directory mounted, where data and configuration files are stored. The container can be used as command-line tool, using a helper script. In this case, you will build your own container image, and use it within a directory on your local machine via a helper script. It can also be used in a cloud environment, with an appropriate sidecar or wrapper. In this case, you will need to add an appropriate API, and file and process handling yourself. This documentation describes the first scenario. The tools are split into steps of a \"compilation pipeline\". The steps in the pipeline are typically small scripts and XSLT transformations. We use Ant as orchestration tool. Other orchestration systems would be possible too. For now, you need to follow the steps for Setting up a development environment. This will create a local Docker container image, and make the helper script available. You can then run the engine in a container on your local machine, using the helper script.

We also include a PlantUML configuration file, which defines variables that can be used to specify colours for diagram elements. Antora generates a static website for technical documentation.

This should only happen if converting the available exports of source data into our template formats would be prohibitively difficult and time-consuming. The templates work on tabular data in the same way as our standard templates. They are implemented using an XSLT mode parameter in the XSLT stylesheet templates. The file spreadsheet-iati/csvxml-s2i.xslt is amended to include these additional templates. It will then override the generic template to process a csv record, and implement its own version. Generic example of including client-specific templates for two clients We convert data for two programmes. The OKP programme is where we use a custom configuration. The StuNed programme uses our regular spreadsheet templates, and is included in the conversion. The IATI activity structure for the whole OKP programme consists of four main pillars. Each pillar can have a subdivision, and underneath that the many individual projects that typically are split by funding round and country. In the case of Nuffic, we have a complex mix of input sources: IATI data exported from Akvo for some programmes This data contains general information and results of a few programmes. However, we filter out certain IATI fields that contain too many errors in the Akvo source. Data in Spreadsheet2IATI templates The top-level activities of the OKP programme are not available as Akvo data. Information for these activities is added manually via our regular templates. Also, the result baselines for several projects are not included in Akvo, and are therefore added manually via our results template. In addition, we manually compiled a countries and regions overview of historical projects. To conclude, at least one other programme with embassy funding maintains their own set of spreadsheets in our regular template format. Exports from an older (Atlas) and newer (Delta) project management system These exports contain additional information about some OKP programmes, and require special logic to construct identifiers from one or more input columns. The Atlas data is only for historical purposes and should not be updated any further. The Delta data is for newer programmes and projects. Export from the financial system (Businessworld) This export contains transaction data. Again, we use specific logic to construct identifiers. Figure 1. General overview of the input sources, and four main process flows. To handle this mix of standard and client-specific templates, the code processes the CSV data in both the normal way, as well as in mode nuffic. This section provides more details about the four main process flows (in blue) for the OKP programme in the diagram above. This information is provided in either our standard templates, or in the Akvo export. For IS activities, we don’t use the Akvo data. We do select specific columns to construct an IATI identifier that is consistent across the various exports. For GT activities, we use different columns to construct the IATI identifier, and combine it with data from the Akvo export. For ICP activities, we again use different columns to construct the IATI identifier, and combine it with data from the Akvo export. This is a regular merge of all produced partial data.

The workbench uses two approaches to working with IATI data: Run as a Docker container It runs all the necessary software within an isolated environment. Run as a software build tool It transforms input source files into output compiled files, via one or more targets. The main code is intended to be used as Docker container. This container should have a workspace directory mounted, where data and configuration files are stored. The container can be used as command-line tool, using a helper script. In this case, you will build your own container image, and use it within a directory on your local machine via a helper script. It can also be used in a cloud environment, with an appropriate sidecar or wrapper. In this case, you will need to add an appropriate API, and file and process handling yourself. This documentation describes the first scenario. The tools are split into steps of a \"compilation pipeline\". The steps in the pipeline are typically small scripts and XSLT transformations. We use Ant as orchestration tool. Other orchestration systems would be possible too. For now, you need to follow the steps for Setting up a development environment.

This section contains a few additional tools to work with IATI data. They are prototypes, used in workshops and for data migration. First, make sure your source directory is checked out for this branch. Then, create a Docker container image as explained in the development:index.adoc#_setting_up_a_development_environment section, specifically for this branch. The last step in the process above will look like this: $ aida-s2i -d -t tools build This should generate a separate image with version tag tools. We can generate (most of) the spreadsheet template contents for an organisation based on their existing IATI data. The ultimate goal is to provide full round-trip conversions for both activities and organisations. However, the current conversion from IATI data to our templates is not fully up to date with the reverse conversion. Go into a workspace directory. Make sure there are one or more IATI files in the src/ directory. Typically, this will be an IATI file generated by for instance Aidstream. Generate Excel spreadsheets: $ aida-s2i -t tools iati-office The resulting spreadsheets will be put into the output/ directory. The file names will be the base name of the source file, followed by the expected template file name for a particular section. We use the yEd graph editor to generate network diagrams of IATI data files. This tool can be used for free, and installed on a local machine. yEd lets the user build hierarchical graphs. This allows us to group IATI activities within IATI organisations. The resulting diagram can be manually cleaned up, and saved as PNG or SVG image. In the SVG version, we add clickable links to activities and organisations. Activities try to open a local HTML page for the activity. Local pages for activities are not implemented in this version. They could also link to a d-portal page, although originally, we supported organisations to review their activity before it was available on d-portal. Organisations link to the d-portal page for the organisation, based on their identifier. Go into a workspace directory. Make sure there are one or more IATI files in the src/ directory. Typically, this will be an IATI file generated with the S2I conversion tool. Generate a network diagram: $ aida-s2i -t tools yed Start yEd and open the appropriate *.graphml file in the output/ directory. All information will be centered and overlapping in the image. Through the Layout menu Hierarchical, or the key combination Alt+Shift+H, the graph can be rendered as either left-to-right, or as top-down overview.","title":"IATI Tools","component":"iati-workbench","version":"tools","name":"index","url":"/iati-workbench/tools/tools/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Docker setup","hash":"_docker_setup","id":1},{"text":"IATI to S2I","hash":"_iati_to_s2i","id":2},{"text":"How to run","hash":"_how_to_run","id":3},{"text":"Network diagrams","hash":"_network_diagrams","id":4},{"text":"How to run","hash":"_how_to_run_2","id":5}]},"24":{"id":24,"text":"The client configuration consists of variables for their organisation name, identifier, and so on.

The Ant build target first copies a generic template sheets-iati.xslt into the config directory.

This should only happen if converting the available exports of source data into our template formats would be prohibitively difficult and time-consuming. The templates work on tabular data in the same way as our standard templates. They are implemented using an XSLT mode parameter in the XSLT stylesheet templates. The file spreadsheet-iati/csvxml-s2i.xslt is amended to include these additional templates. It will then override the generic template to process a csv record, and implement its own version. Generic example of including client-specific templates for two clients We convert data for two programmes. The OKP programme is where we use a custom configuration. The StuNed programme uses our regular spreadsheet templates, and is included in the conversion. The IATI activity structure for the whole OKP programme consists of four main pillars. Each pillar can have a subdivision, and underneath that the many individual projects that typically are split by funding round and country. In the case of Nuffic, we have a complex mix of input sources: IATI data exported from Akvo for some programmes This data contains general information and results of a few programmes. However, we filter out certain IATI fields that contain too many errors in the Akvo source. Data in Spreadsheet2IATI templates The top-level activities of the OKP programme are not available as Akvo data. Information for these activities is added manually via our regular templates. Also, the result baselines for several projects are not included in Akvo, and are therefore added manually via our results template. In addition, we manually compiled a countries and regions overview of historical projects. To conclude, at least one other programme with embassy funding maintains their own set of spreadsheets in our regular template format. Exports from an older (Atlas) and newer (Delta) project management system These exports contain additional information about some OKP programmes, and require special logic to construct identifiers from one or more input columns. The Atlas data is only for historical purposes and should not be updated any further. The Delta data is for newer programmes and projects. Export from the financial system (Businessworld) This export contains transaction data. Again, we use specific logic to construct identifiers. Figure 1. General overview of the input sources, and four main process flows. To handle this mix of standard and client-specific templates, the code processes the CSV data in both the normal way, as well as in mode nuffic. This section provides more details about the four main process flows (in blue) for the OKP programme in the diagram above. This information is provided in either our standard templates, or in the Akvo export. For IS activities, we don’t use the Akvo data. We do select specific columns to construct an IATI identifier that is consistent across the various exports. For GT activities, we use different columns to construct the IATI identifier, and combine it with data from the Akvo export. For ICP activities, we again use different columns to construct the IATI identifier, and combine it with data from the Akvo export. This is a regular merge of all produced partial data. It includes the StuNed data as well.","title":"Client-specific templates","component":"iati-workbench","version":"tools","name":"client-specific-templates","url":"/iati-workbench/tools/spreadsheets2iati/reference/client-specific-templates.html","titles":[{"text":"Adding client-specific templates","hash":"_adding_client_specific_templates","id":1},{"text":"Case: Nuffic","hash":"_case_nuffic","id":2},{"text":"Structure of the OKP programme","hash":"_structure_of_the_okp_programme","id":3},{"text":"Processing","hash":"_processing","id":4},{"text":"Top-level IATI activities (process main structure)","hash":"_top_level_iati_activities_process_main_structure","id":5},{"text":"Individual Scholarships activities (process IS data)","hash":"_individual_scholarships_activities_process_is_data","id":6},{"text":"Group Training activities (process GT data)","hash":"_group_training_activities_process_gt_data","id":7},{"text":"Institutional Collaboration Projects (process ICP data)","hash":"_institutional_collaboration_projects_process_icp_data","id":8},{"text":"Merge the data","hash":"_merge_the_data","id":9}]},"26":{"id":26,"text":"The spreadsheet convertor makes an effort to process dates properly.

Run as a software build tool It transforms input source files into output compiled files, via one or more targets. The main code is intended to be used as Docker container. This container should have a workspace directory mounted, where data and configuration files are stored. The container can be used as command-line tool, using a helper script. In this case, you will build your own container image, and use it within a directory on your local machine via a helper script. It can also be used in a cloud environment, with an appropriate sidecar or wrapper. In this case, you will need to add an appropriate API, and file and process handling yourself.

This way, when that user runs the helper script, and mounts a local directory, all generated files and directories will also be owned by that current user. It also means that the Docker image is only portable to other machines if it can run under the same user id. The user id is not the same as the user name! Typically, a Linux system will start regular user ids at 1000 or 1001. There are two modes to work on the codebase. Within the source directory, the targets in the Ant build file and the scripts in the npm package file are available.

This should only happen if converting the available exports of source data into our template formats would be prohibitively difficult and time-consuming. The templates work on tabular data in the same way as our standard templates. They are implemented using an XSLT mode parameter in the XSLT stylesheet templates. The file spreadsheet-iati/csvxml-s2i.xslt is amended to include these additional templates. It will then override the generic template to process a csv record, and implement its own version. Generic example of including client-specific templates for two clients We convert data for two programmes. The OKP programme is where we use a custom configuration. The StuNed programme uses our regular spreadsheet templates, and is included in the conversion. The IATI activity structure for the whole OKP programme consists of four main pillars. Each pillar can have a subdivision, and underneath that the many individual projects that typically are split by funding round and country. In the case of Nuffic, we have a complex mix of input sources: IATI data exported from Akvo for some programmes This data contains general information and results of a few programmes. However, we filter out certain IATI fields that contain too many errors in the Akvo source. Data in Spreadsheet2IATI templates The top-level activities of the OKP programme are not available as Akvo data. Information for these activities is added manually via our regular templates. Also, the result baselines for several projects are not included in Akvo, and are therefore added manually via our results template. In addition, we manually compiled a countries and regions overview of historical projects. To conclude, at least one other programme with embassy funding maintains their own set of spreadsheets in our regular template format. Exports from an older (Atlas) and newer (Delta) project management system These exports contain additional information about some OKP programmes, and require special logic to construct identifiers from one or more input columns. The Atlas data is only for historical purposes and should not be updated any further. The Delta data is for newer programmes and projects. Export from the financial system (Businessworld) This export contains transaction data. Again, we use specific logic to construct identifiers. Figure 1. General overview of the input sources, and four main process flows. To handle this mix of standard and client-specific templates, the code processes the CSV data in both the normal way, as well as in mode nuffic. This section provides more details about the four main process flows (in blue) for the OKP programme in the diagram above. This information is provided in either our standard templates, or in the Akvo export. For IS activities, we don’t use the Akvo data. We do select specific columns to construct an IATI identifier that is consistent across the various exports. For GT activities, we use different columns to construct the IATI identifier, and combine it with data from the Akvo export. For ICP activities, we again use different columns to construct the IATI identifier, and combine it with data from the Akvo export. This is a regular merge of all produced partial data. It includes the StuNed data as well.","title":"Client-specific templates","component":"iati-workbench","version":"1.9.1","name":"client-specific-templates","url":"/iati-workbench/1.9.1/spreadsheets2iati/reference/client-specific-templates.html","titles":[{"text":"Adding client-specific templates","hash":"_adding_client_specific_templates","id":1},{"text":"Case: Nuffic","hash":"_case_nuffic","id":2},{"text":"Structure of the OKP programme","hash":"_structure_of_the_okp_programme","id":3},{"text":"Processing","hash":"_processing","id":4},{"text":"Top-level IATI activities (process main structure)","hash":"_top_level_iati_activities_process_main_structure","id":5},{"text":"Individual Scholarships activities (process IS data)","hash":"_individual_scholarships_activities_process_is_data","id":6},{"text":"Group Training activities (process GT data)","hash":"_group_training_activities_process_gt_data","id":7},{"text":"Institutional Collaboration Projects (process ICP data)","hash":"_institutional_collaboration_projects_process_icp_data","id":8},{"text":"Merge the data","hash":"_merge_the_data","id":9}]},"39":{"id":39,"text":"The spreadsheet convertor makes an effort to process dates properly.
